## Detect and remove primers (if necessary)

  - Forward primer = **514F-Y**
  - Reverse primer = **806RB**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
FWD = "GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA"
REV = "GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT"

#Now, create a function that generates all possible orientations of the forward and reverse primers 
allOrients <- function(primer) {
  require(Biostrings)
  dna <- DNAString(primer)
  orients <- c(Forward = dna, Complement = complement(dna), Reverse = reverse(dna), 
               RevComp = reverseComplement(dna))
  return(sapply(orients, toString))
}

#Apply the function to the forward adn reverse primers to get the possible orientations
FWD.orients <- allOrients(FWD)
REV.orients <- allOrients(REV)


FWD.orients
```

    ##               Forward            Complement               Reverse 
    ## "GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA" "CACRGTCGKCGGCGCCATT" "AATGGCGCCGMCGACYGTG" 
    ##               RevComp 
    ## "TTACCGCGGCKGCTGRCAC"

``` r
REV.orients
```

    ##                Forward             Complement                Reverse 
    ## "GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT" "CCTGATGNBCCCAWAGATTA" "TAATCTWTGGGVNCATCAGG" 
    ##                RevComp 
    ## "ATTAGAWACCCBNGTAGTCC"

Now that we have the possible orientations of the primer we want to
search for their occurence in the sequence files and remove the data if
necessary.

``` r
primerHits <- function(primer, fn) {
  # Counts number of reads in which the primer is found
  nhits <- vcountPattern(primer, sread(readFastq(fn)), fixed = FALSE)
  return(sum(nhits > 0))
}

rbind(FWD.ForwardReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs[[1]]), 
      FWD.ReverseReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs[[1]]), 
      REV.ForwardReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs[[1]]), 
      REV.ReverseReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs[[1]]))
```

    ##                  Forward Complement Reverse RevComp
    ## FWD.ForwardReads       0          0       0       0
    ## FWD.ReverseReads       0          0       0     283
    ## REV.ForwardReads       0          0       0    1195
    ## REV.ReverseReads       0          0       0       0

There are a ton of occurences of the reverse complement in the forward
reverse reads and the reverse forward read, but weâ€™re just gonna keep on
forging forward? The video tutorials also had some occurences of the
reverse complement.

## Create quality profiles

Quality profiles allow the user to assess the quality of the reads and
determine if the sequence needs to be run again.

  - Gray scale = Frequency of each quality score @ each base position
  - Green = mean quality score
  - Orange = quartiles for quality score at each base position

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Generate quality profile for the forward read 
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[1:12])
```

![](Dada2_analysis_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Like the video tutorials, the quality score seems to be fairly high for
the forward direction. We will follow the tutorial and trim off the last
10 cycles for the forward direction.

``` r
# Generate quality profile for the reverse read 
plotQualityProfile(fnRs[1:12])
```

![](Dada2_analysis_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

The reverse reads are much lower quality when compared to the forward
reads. However, like the tutorial the quality seems to be OK until \~150
cycle. We will trim the data there.

## Filtering and Trimming the Data

Based on our visual inspection of the quality profiles we want to filter
and trim the data. However, first we want to create a separate folder
that contains the trimmed data so that we can leave the original
sequences alone/unaltered.

``` r
# This line gives the names of all the samples of the forward direction (same names as the reverse direction)
sample.names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(fnFs),"_L"), `[`,1)
sample.names
```

## Generating the error model and plotting the results

``` r
errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, multithread = TRUE)
```

    ## 104972400 total bases in 437385 reads from 10 samples will be used for learning the error rates.

``` r
errR <- learnErrors(filtRs, multithread = TRUE)
```

    ## 104130300 total bases in 694202 reads from 16 samples will be used for learning the error rates.

The error plot elements are as follows:

  - X axis = quality score (Based on quality profiles)
  - Y axis = error frequency
  - Error rates between each possible transition
  - Points = observed error rates
  - Black line = Estimated error rates
  - Red line = Error rates expected via quality score

TLDR: Error rates drop with increasing quality score

``` r
plotErrors(errF, nominalQ = TRUE)
```

merged dataset of the forward and reverse reads that minimizes error and
overlap. This dataset will have the number of unique sequences as well
as information on average sequence lengths.

Next, we want to merge the forward and reverse datasets. This supposedly
reduces error by reducing the amount of overlap between the datasets. We
can also remove issues that we noticed with the reverse complement
primer earlier in this tutorial with the *trimOverhang = T* argument.
Supposedly, the reverse read often extends past the forward read,
resulting in issues when we look at the reverse complement primer. This
command trims that extension.

``` r
mergers <- mergePairs(dadaFs, derepFs, dadaRs, derepRs, verbose = TRUE, trimOverhang = T)
```

Then, we save the merged dataset for use in future assignments.

``` r
saveRDS(mergers, 'dada_merged.RDS')
```

Construct a sequence table:

``` r
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(mergers)

# Look at the dimensions of the table
dim(seqtab)
```

    ## [1]  24 815

*Note: The columns represent unique sequences.* There are 815 unique
sequences in the amplicon library

Checking the distribution of sequence lengths

``` r
table(nchar(getSequences(seqtab))) 
```

    ## 
    ## 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 265 266 270 373 
    ##  21 739  39   2   4   1   3   1   1   3   1

The first row is the sequence lengths. The second row is the number of
occureneces of the lengths. We can see that most sequences are around
253 base pairs long with some distribution on either side.

## Removing chimeras

It is helpful to start off with a definition of what chimeras actually
are:

Chimeras = Biological sequences that attach to each other. Results in
amplification of non-biological sequence.

TLDR: We want to remove chimeras from the dataset.

``` r
seqtab.nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab, verbose = TRUE)
```

    ## Identified 47 bimeras out of 815 input sequences.

``` r
dim(seqtab.nochim)
```

    ## [1]  24 768

``` r
## Check to see what proportion of the dataset was comprised of chimeras 
sum(seqtab.nochim)/sum(seqtab)
```

    ## [1] 0.9951978

So \~ 0.5% of the dataset was comprised of chimeric sequences.

## Assigning taxonomy based on a reference database

Almost doneâ€¦ We now want to assign the unique sequences in our database
to taxonomic groupings in a reference database.

``` r
taxa <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab.nochim, "../Input_Data/week5/Reference_Database/silva_nr_v138_train_set.fa", multithread = TRUE)
```

Andâ€¦ we want to save our datasets for future use\!

*Note: Took \~5 minutes to assign taxonomy on my computer*

``` r
saveRDS(t(seqtab.nochim), "seqtab-nochimtaxa.rds")
saveRDS(taxa,"taxa.rds")
```

And somehow my computer managed to not explode while attempting to run
through these giant dataframes.

*End*
