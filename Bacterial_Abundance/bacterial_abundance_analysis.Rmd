```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

## Loading in the data 

```{r}
# First let's see what sheets are within the xcel file that we will be working with 
excel_sheets("../Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx")

#Import the metadata 
metadata <- read_excel("../Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet="Metadata")

#unique treatments 
unique(metadata$Treatment)
```

Properties of this dataset

- Only **1 location** and one depth is sampled 
- There are **8 bottles** labeled (A-H)
- There are **9 timepoints** taken for each bottle 
- There are **4 treatments.** Control, ash leachate, mud leachate and the GNP mix. 
- There are **3 DNA samples** taken per bottle. 

```{r}
# Import the actual data 
data <- read_excel("../Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet="Data")

# Now, we join the actual data to the metadata 
joined <- left_join(metadata, data)

```

So now we have a dataset that contains the number of cells. *left_join()* synchronzied Cells_ml by Bottle and Timepoint 

## Data exploration/basic manipulation 

```{r}
str(joined)
```

We need to: 

- Convert cells/mL -> cells/L 
- Calculate duration between timepoints based on treatment and bottle 
- remove rows with NA values for cells 

``` {r}
cells <- joined %>% 
  mutate(Datetime = ymd_hm(Datetime), 
         cells_L = Cells_ml * 1000) %>% 
  drop_na(cells_L) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Bottle) %>% 
  mutate(interv = interval(first(Datetime), Datetime), 
         dur = as.duration(interv),
         days = as.numeric(dur, "days")) %>% 
  mutate(cells_sd = sd(cells_L)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
  

str(cells)
```


## Basic data visualization 
Normally, we could create a variable to store the order in which elements should appear. Rather than set the levels in every plot I decided to edit the column "Treatment" to display information in the desired order. Therefore, the treatment variable appears in the specified order **for all future figures.**

```{r}
levels <- c("Control", "Ash Leachate", "Mud Leachate", "Glucose_Nitrate_Phosphate")

# This line orders the treatment variable by the specified order for all future figures
cells$Treatment <- factor(cells$Treatment, levels = levels)

cells %>% 
  mutate(dna = ifelse(DNA_Sample == TRUE, "*", NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days, y=cells_L, color=Treatment, 
             group = interaction(Treatment, Bottle)))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = cells_L - cells_sd, ymax = cells_L + cells_sd), width=0.1)+
  labs(x = "Days", y = expression(paste("Cells L"^-1)))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(row="Treatment", scales="free")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dna), size=12, color="black")+
  theme_bw()


```

From the plot, it appears that Ash Leachate and GNP treatments had the greatest abundance of bacterial cells (note the free y axis). The Mud Leachate and Control treatments seem very similar, indicating that the addition of mud leachate had little effect on bacterial abundance (although a T test/One-way ANOVA + TuskeyHSD test is needed to say for sure). 


For the next part we need to plot the ln(cell_abundance) vs time (days). We will visually estimate where graph is linear. The slope of this linear portion will give us the specific growth rate. 

```{r}
ln_cells <- cells %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Bottle) %>% 
  mutate(ln_cells = log(cells_L), 
         diff_ln_cells = ln_cells-lag(ln_cells, default=first(ln_cells))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Once we have calculated the difference in the natural log of the cell counts we can just plot the same graph and visually check for where the lines appear linear. 

```{r}
# Trying to display all 4 treatments and bottles in one graph makes it impossible to distinguish the linear portion
## Therefore, I am trying to split the dataset into two treatments each to make it easier to visualize 
ln_control_ash <- ln_cells %>% 
  filter(Treatment %in% c("Control", "Ash Leachate"))

ln_control_ash %>% 
  mutate(dna = ifelse(DNA_Sample == TRUE, "*", NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days, y=diff_ln_cells, color=Treatment, 
             group = interaction(Treatment, Bottle)))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  labs(x = "Days", y = expression(paste("Change in ln(Cells) L"^-1)), title="Change in ln(Cells) in control + ash treatments over time")+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(Bottle~Treatment, scales="free")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dna), size=12, color="black")+
  theme_bw()

# Second graph, showing mud and GNP solution 
ln_mud_GNP <- ln_cells %>% 
  filter(Treatment %in% c("Mud Leachate", "Glucose_Nitrate_Phosphate"))

ln_mud_GNP %>% 
  mutate(dna = ifelse(DNA_Sample == TRUE, "*", NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days, y=diff_ln_cells, color=Treatment, 
             group = interaction(Treatment, Bottle)))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  labs(x = "Days", y = expression(paste("Change in ln(Cells) L"^-1)), title="Change in ln(Cells) in mud + GNP treatments over time")+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(Bottle~Treatment, scales="free")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dna), size=12, color="black")+
  theme_bw()

```

Based on the graphs the we can visually estimate where exponential growth (the log phase) occurs for each bottle: 

- Control, Bottle A, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Control, Bottle B, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Ash Leachate, Bottle C, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Ash Leachate, Bottle D, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Mud Leachate, Bottle E, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Mud Leachate, Bottle F, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)

- GNP, Bottle G, ~0-1d (T0-T2)
- GNP, Bottle H, ~0-1d (T0-T2)

## Calculate growth rates, doubling times and change in cell abundances 

```{r}
growth <- ln_cells %>% 
  mutate(exp_start = 0, 
         exp_end = ifelse(Treatment=="Glucose_Nitrate_Phosphate", 2, 1)) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Bottle) %>% 
  mutate(ln_cells_exp_start = ifelse(exp_start == Timepoint, ln_cells, NA), 
         ln_cells_exp_end = ifelse(exp_end == Timepoint, ln_cells, NA), 
         cells_exp_start = ifelse(exp_start == Timepoint, cells_L, NA), 
         cells_exp_end = ifelse(exp_end == Timepoint, cells_L, NA), 
         days_exp_start = ifelse(exp_start == Timepoint, days, NA), 
         days_exp_end = ifelse(exp_end == Timepoint, days, NA),) %>%
  fill(ln_cells_exp_start:days_exp_end, .direction="downup") %>%
  fill(ln_cells_exp_end, .direction="updown") %>% 
  mutate(mew = (ln_cells_exp_end - ln_cells_exp_start)/(days_exp_end - days_exp_start), 
         doubling_time = log(2)/mew, 
         delta_cells = cells_exp_end - first(cells_L)) %>% 
  ungroup() 


check <- growth %>%  
  select(Treatment, Bottle, Timepoint, ln_cells, exp_start, exp_end, cells_exp_start, cells_exp_end, mew, doubling_time)

```


## Calculate Bacterical Carbon 

- Convert bacterial abundance and change in bacterial abundance to C units 
- Apply a C conversion factor to bacterial abundnace (cells/L)
- This generates bacterial carbon (µmol C/L)

We will apply C content of bacterioplankton cells from Coastal Japan (-10 fg C/cell)

- Fukuda et. al., 1998

```{r}
batCarbon <- growth %>% 
  mutate(bc = cells_L * (2.5 * 10^-9), 
         deltaBc = delta_cells * (2.5*10^-9))

str(batCarbon)

```

## Calculating Treatment Averages 

Now that we have verified that the data from each bottle seems valid, it can be helpful to calculate the average values for important properties. In the following code chunk we will calculate the average values and standard deviation for: 

- Bacterial Carbon/cell 
- Specific growth rate 
- Doubling time 
- Change in cells over experiment 
- Change in cell C over experiment 

As a bonus we can also calculate the average duration of the lag phase over the course of the experiment 

```{r}
averages <- batCarbon %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Timepoint) %>% 
  mutate(avg_bc = mean(bc), 
         sd_bc = sd(bc)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(Treatment) %>% 
  mutate(avg_mew = mean(mew), 
         sd_mew = sd(mew), 
         avg_doubling_time = mean(doubling_time), 
         sd_doubling_time = sd(doubling_time), 
         avg_delta_cells = mean(delta_cells), 
         sd_delta_cells = sd(delta_cells), 
         avg_delta_bc = mean(deltaBc), 
         sd_delta_bc = sd(deltaBc), 
         avg_lag_phase_dur = mean(days_exp_start)) %>% 
  ungroup()

subset <- averages %>% 
  select(Treatment, Timepoint, Bottle, bc, avg_bc, sd_bc)
  
# write.csv(averages, "bacterialCarbon.csv")
# saveRDS(averages, file="bacterialCarbon.RDS")


```

Now that we have the dataset made with a bunch of average values we can make a plot!

First up, average carbon/cell 

```{r}
ggplot(averages, aes(x=days, y=avg_bc, color=Treatment))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin= avg_bc - sd_bc, ymax = avg_bc + sd_bc), width=0.1)+
  facet_grid(row = "Treatment")+
  labs(x="Days", y=expression("Bacterial Carbon µmol C L"^-1))+
  theme_bw()

```

This plot shows the average bacterial carbon for four different treatments. It appears that **Ash Leachate** and **GNP** treatments had the highest bacterial carbon/cell. Mud Leachate does not appear to be significantly different from the Control treatment (statistical test needed). 

## Visualizing the rest of the data

We were able to plot average carbon/cell, but we have a bunch of other values! However, there is only one value for each treatment, so we will be making use of a new graph.... The column graph! 

```{r}
## First we need to subset the data to only include the variables of interest 
bar_data <- averages %>% 
  select(Location, Treatment, avg_mew:avg_lag_phase_dur)

## For further simplification we will only return unique values with the distinct() function 
bar_data <- bar_data %>% 
  distinct()

```

## Let's start plotting! 

```{r}
avg_mew <- ggplot(bar_data, aes(x=Treatment, y=avg_mew))+
  geom_col(fill="white", color="black")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=avg_mew-sd_mew, ymax = avg_mew + sd_mew), width=0.1)+
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("µ, d"^-1))+
  theme_bw()

avg_mew

```

This graph represents "mew" or the specific growth rate. Ash Leachate and GNP treatments had the highest specific growth rate, followed by Mud Leachate and then the control. We can generally take this to mean that Ash Leachate and GNP treatments experienced the fastest increase in bacterial cell abundance. 

*Note: Mud Leachate standard error was so small that it did not appear on the graph. However, it is still there!*


```{r}
avg_doubling_time <- ggplot(bar_data, aes(x=Treatment, y=avg_doubling_time))+
  geom_col(fill="white", color="black")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=avg_doubling_time-sd_doubling_time, ymax = avg_doubling_time + sd_doubling_time), width=0.1)+
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("Doubling Time (days)"))+
  theme_bw()

avg_doubling_time

```

The Control treatment had the greatest doubling time. This means that it took the longest time for the population to double — it experienced the slowest growth in its population. Ash Leachate and GNP treatments were able to double their population in the shortest time frame! 


```{r}
avg_delta_bc <- ggplot(bar_data, aes(x=Treatment, y=avg_delta_bc))+
  geom_col(fill="white", color="black")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=avg_delta_bc-sd_delta_bc, ymax = avg_delta_bc + sd_delta_bc), width=0.1)+
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("Change in Bacterial Carbon, µmol C L"^-1))+
  theme_bw()

avg_delta_bc

```

```{r}
avg_lag_phase_dur <- ggplot(bar_data, aes(x=Treatment, y=avg_lag_phase_dur))+
  geom_col(fill="white", color="black")+
  labs(x="Treatment", y=expression("Average Duration of Lag Phase, days"))+
  theme_bw()

avg_lag_phase_dur

```

This is a bit odd. After some review, the "log" phase started at day 0, timepoint 0 for all treatments. Therefore, the average duration of the log phase is... zero! It is unclear whether the bacteria were able to quickly take advantage of nutrients or whether delayed sampling simply missed the lag phase of bacterial growth. 


```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=13}
library(patchwork)

avg_mew + avg_delta_bc + avg_doubling_time + avg_lag_phase_dur + plot_annotation(tag_levels="a")

```


A summary of all figures. From these graphs we can determine that additions of **ash leachate** had the greatest positive effect on bacterial growth and abundance. GNP treatments were similarly effective, with slightly higher bacterial carbon. Mud Leachate treatments were somewhat effective in increasing bacterial growth rate and bacterial carbon. However, it appears to be a much lower quality source of carbon when compared to ash lechate.
