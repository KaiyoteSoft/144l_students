```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

## Loading in the data 

```{r}
# First let's see what sheets are within the xcel file that we will be working with 
excel_sheets("../Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx")

#Import the metadata 
metadata <- read_excel("../Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet="Metadata")

#unique treatments 
unique(metadata$Treatment)
```

Properties of this dataset
- Only **1 location** and one depth is sampled 
- There are **8 bottles** labeled (A-H)
- There are **9 timepoints** taken for each bottle 
- There are **4 treatments.** Control, ash leachate, mud leachate and the GNP mix. 
- There are **3 DNA samples** taken per bottle. 

```{r}
# Import the actual data 
data <- read_excel("../Input_Data/week3/144L_2018_BactAbund.xlsx", sheet="Data")

# Now, we join the actual data to the metadata 
joined <- left_join(metadata, data)

```

So now we have a dataset that contains the number of cells. *left_join()* synchronzied Cells_ml by Bottle and Timepoint 

## Data exploration/basic manipulation 

```{r}
str(joined)
```

We need to: 

- Convert cells/mL -> cells/L 
- Calculate duration between timepoints based on treatment and bottle 
- remove rows with NA values for cells 

``` {r}
cells <- joined %>% 
  mutate(Datetime = ymd_hm(Datetime), 
         cells_L = Cells_ml * 1000) %>% 
  drop_na(cells_L) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Bottle) %>% 
  mutate(interv = interval(first(Datetime), Datetime), 
         dur = as.duration(interv),
         days = as.numeric(dur, "days")) %>% 
  mutate(cells_sd = sd(cells_L)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
  

str(cells)
```


## Basic data visualization 
Normally, we could create a variable to store the order in which elements should appear. However, I am happy with the default ordering. 

```{r}
levels <- c("Control", "Ash Leachate", "Mud Leachate", "Glucose_Nitrate_Phosphate")

# This line orders the treatment variable by the specified order for all future figures
cells$Treatment <- factor(cells$Treatment, levels = levels)

cells %>% 
  mutate(dna = ifelse(DNA_Sample == TRUE, "*", NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days, y=cells_L, color=Treatment, 
             group = interaction(Treatment, Bottle)))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = cells_L - cells_sd, ymax = cells_L + cells_sd), width=0.1)+
  labs(x = "Days", y = expression(paste("Cells L"^-1)))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(row="Treatment", scales="free")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dna), size=12, color="black")+
  theme_bw()


```

For the next part we need to plot the ln(cell_abundance) vs time (days). We will visually estimate where graph is linear. The slope of this linear portion will give us the specific growth rate. 

```{r}
ln_cells <- cells %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Bottle) %>% 
  mutate(ln_cells = log(cells_L), 
         diff_ln_cells = ln_cells-lag(ln_cells, default=first(ln_cells))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Once we have calculated the difference in the natural log of the cell counts we can just plot the same graph and visually check for where the lines appear linear. 

```{r}
# Trying to display all 4 treatments and bottles in one graph makes it impossible to distinguish the linear portion
## Therefore, I am trying to split the dataset into two treatments each to make it easier to visualize 
ln_control_ash <- ln_cells %>% 
  filter(Treatment %in% c("Control", "Ash Leachate"))

ln_control_ash %>% 
  mutate(dna = ifelse(DNA_Sample == TRUE, "*", NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days, y=diff_ln_cells, color=Treatment, 
             group = interaction(Treatment, Bottle)))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  labs(x = "Days", y = expression(paste("Change in ln(Cells) L"^-1)), title="Change in ln(Cells) in control + ash treatments over time")+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(Bottle~Treatment, scales="free")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dna), size=12, color="black")+
  theme_bw()

# Second graph, showing mud and GNP solution 
ln_mud_GNP <- ln_cells %>% 
  filter(Treatment %in% c("Mud Leachate", "Glucose_Nitrate_Phosphate"))

ln_mud_GNP %>% 
  mutate(dna = ifelse(DNA_Sample == TRUE, "*", NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=days, y=diff_ln_cells, color=Treatment, 
             group = interaction(Treatment, Bottle)))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  labs(x = "Days", y = expression(paste("Change in ln(Cells) L"^-1)), title="Change in ln(Cells) in mud + GNP treatments over time")+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(Bottle~Treatment, scales="free")+
  geom_text(aes(label=dna), size=12, color="black")+
  theme_bw()

```

Based on the graphs the we can visually estimate where exponential growth occurs for each bottle: 

- Control, Bottle A, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Control, Bottle B, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Ash Leachate, Bottle C, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Ash Leachate, Bottle D, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Mud Leachate, Bottle E, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)
- Mud Leachate, Bottle F, ~0-0.5d (T0-T1)

- GNP, Bottle G, ~0-1d (T0-T2)
- GNP, Bottle H, ~0-1d (T0-T2)

```{r}
growth <- ln_cells %>% 
  mutate(exp_start = 0, 
         exp_end = ifelse(Treatment=="Glucose_Nitrate_Phosphate", 2, 1)) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Bottle) %>% 
  mutate(ln_cells_exp_start = ifelse(exp_start == Timepoint, ln_cells, NA), 
         ln_cells_exp_end = ifelse(exp_end == Timepoint, ln_cells, NA), 
         cells_exp_start = ifelse(exp_start == Timepoint, cells_L, NA), 
         cells_exp_end = ifelse(exp_end == Timepoint, cells_L, NA), 
         days_exp_start = ifelse(exp_start == Timepoint, days, NA), 
         days_exp_end = ifelse(exp_end == Timepoint, days, NA),) %>%
  fill(ln_cells_exp_start:days_exp_end, .direction="downup") %>%
  fill(ln_cells_exp_end, .direction="updown") %>% 
  mutate(mew = (ln_cells_exp_end - ln_cells_exp_start)/(days_exp_end - days_exp_start), 
         doubling_time = log(2)/mew, 
         delta_cells = cells_exp_end - first(cells_L)) %>% 
  ungroup() 


check <- growth %>%  
  select(Treatment, Bottle, Timepoint, ln_cells, exp_start, exp_end, cells_exp_start, cells_exp_end, mew, doubling_time)

```
